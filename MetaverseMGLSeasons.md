# Metaverse-MGL-Seasons

Metaverse MGL have three season, in each season Metaverse MGL try to take a firm step towards decentralization.

**First season Genesis landÂ **

Metaverse MGL is an independent virtual reality world with defined and extensible standards that seeks to challenge real-time virtual reality technologies using research and modeling.
The first embodiment of the Metaverse MGL is to have a decentralized virtual reality network with Earth called Genesis,
In Genesis, landowners and residents can have their own rules and world, there are no restrictions or rules from the creators and designers of MGL for Genesis lands. All laws are made, written and enforced by the landowners and residents themselves.
There are no restrictions on Genesis land for its inhabitants and owners.
Your limit in the realm of Genesis is your imagination.
That's why we call the first period Genesis.

**Second season Blockchain**

Metaverse MGL has sought complete network independence from the beginning and has been designed to the standards of a decentralized network. After the complete launch of Genesis to realize all the dreams of Genesis, the MGL team begins the second phase of this decentralized world;
Dedicated blockchain design for complete independence of Metaverse MGL network and Genesis lands.
As we have said Genesis starts in BEP20 working but we will go to MGL20 network to continue; The goal is to upgrade the network for greater Scalability as well as Genesis independence.
Ultimately, Genesis will be a decentralized, non-affiliated land with a dedicated blockchain that will be managed by its inhabitants; Unlike most Metaverse projects that focus only on the game and use the Unity platform, which is one of the most advanced 3D development platforms, Genesis has focused entirely on the virtual reality field and the game as the program is part of Genesis Land.

**Third season**

The final step in the Metaverse Mgl network is web3 technology. In Genesis we have no restrictions on independence, the main goal of Genesis, which has been said many times, is a decentralized network, without the interference of governments or the capitalist system. Unlike networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Amazon and other platforms that misuse their users' data and, in these networks, everything is centralized and in control of the network. in the world of Genesis, the Internet will be formed differently, Genesis Like the ICP network, it does not seek to heal the limitations of the Internet network. the main goal is to have an independent network, Genesis is trying to provide users with the correct form of network. Metaverse Mgl  honored to announce that, as we have said before, the Genesis Network will achieve this by using the satellite Internet and the bandwidth it has, and as the number of satellites increases.
